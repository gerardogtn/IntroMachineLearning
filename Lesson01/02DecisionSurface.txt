A DECISION SURFACE takes a scatter plot as a foundation, and
creates a divisory line (not necessarily a straight line) that divides
the plot into two categories. If a data point is said to lie on the surface
A of the scatter plot then it is said to have characteristic X and thus belong
to classification R. On the other hand, if the data point lies on the surface B,
then it is said to have characteristic Y and thus belongs to classification S.
Lastly, if the point lies on the divisory line or very close to this line,
then it is said to be unclear on its characteristics and thus doesn't clearly
belong to any of the classifications.

Note this method is binary, dichotomous, and 2-dimensional; if you want to
distinguish between more than two classifications, then several divisory lines
would need to be included. If, on the other hand you want to distinguish between
more than two features, then a n-dimensional plot would need to be used. It's
important to notice that a computer doesn't actually plot the data and could
figure n-dimensional stuff out, but for our human comprehension is easier to
think in 2D.

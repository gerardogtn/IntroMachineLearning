Supervised Classification.
  Supervised: Someone is telling you how to do things.

Basically, you create a program and you feed it a number of examples
for the things that you are trying to classify. The program will look for
common features and distinct features and try to classify accordingly.

For instance, Supervised Classification for four-leged animals.

DATA FED. (Animal, Y/N)
Parrot   N
Donkey   Y
Horse    Y
Giraffe  Y
Goldfish N
Wolf     Y
Dog      Y
Bee      N
Ant      N
Kangaroo N

So, assuming that each animal has a distinct set of features, then you could
ask the program to classify new animals and tell you if its a four-leged animal
or not.

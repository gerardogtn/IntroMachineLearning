Use Naive Bayes to perform text learning, and predict the author of some
emails.

There will be two possible authors:
  - Chris.
  - Sarah.

You will have some text files and their respective authors.
From that, callibrate the Naive Bayes algorithm.
Then, given a text file predict which author wrote the file.
